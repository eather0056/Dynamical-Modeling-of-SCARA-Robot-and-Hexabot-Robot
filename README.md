# Hexapod-Robot
This project focuses on designing a 3-DOF (Degrees of Freedom) Hexapod robot frame using SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) architecture. It incorporates Frame and Denavit-Hartenberg (DH)/Khalil formalism principles for precise kinematic modeling and control. The project is implemented using MATLAB Simulink and SolidWorks, combining theoretical analysis with practical design and simulation for an innovative Hexapod robot.
